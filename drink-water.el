;;; Commentary:
;; This package reminds you to drink water at smart intervals based on your
;; needs. It calculates your daily water requirement, tracks your intake, and
;; motivates you with hydration quotes.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'alert)

;; Quotes are now loaded from the `drink-water-quotes' variable in
;; `drink-water-quotes.el'.

;; Require the quotes file
(require 'drink-water-quotes)
